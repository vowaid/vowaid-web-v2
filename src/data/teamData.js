    bio: `<p>Having studied Advertising and Marketing at Eastern Michigan University, Lisa started her professional career as a Media Assistant at Heil Brice Retail Advertising. Quickly proving her worth, Lisa was reappointed to Account Manager at the same firm, where she was responsible for an annual budget of over $10 million. She excelled in this role because of her extraordinary communication skills, collaborating and coordinating with many other teams to achieve everyone's goals.</p>

    <p>Always on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities, Lisa moved to ABC Disney radio where she was responsible for introducing radio advertising concepts to both advertising agencies and local clients. While apart of ABC Disney radio she maintained one of the highest average unit sale rates on her team, organized massive event promotions for large clients including McDonalds and TCF Bank, and she developed several successful campaigns for clients with limited budgets to ensure that they could meet their targets and achieve their goals.</p>

    <p>Simultaneously, Lisa worked in the Marine Corps Reserve as a motor vehicle operator and as a member of the Peacetime Wartime support team during 9/11. During her time with the Marine Corps, Lisa realized her love for country and her desire to help others at home and around the world, especially children. Lisa began spearheading fundraisers and charitable events for local youth and military families.</p>

    <p>Lisa also started a training center for cheerleaders by the name of Michigan Xtreme Cheer and Dance. Here, kids, teenagers, and special needs children were not only athletically trained, but mentored by Lisa and her staff. Quite the optimist, Lisa believes in living life to the fullest and giving back to the community as much as possible, regularly hosting fundraising events and awareness campaigns for various local charities.</p>

    <p>Constantly looking for opportunities to help those in need, Lisa discovered the Veterans of War Aid Foundation. A veteran herself, Lisa understood the struggles of veterans and felt compelled to get involved with the Veterans of War Aid Foundation to help provide her fellow countrymen with the help they need to prosper and survive their unique challenges.</p>

    <p>In 2012, Lisa earned the title of Mrs. Michigan which gave her an even larger platform to bring attention to the charitable causes she was passionate about. As an advocate for charity work and an experienced mentor, Lisa believes she can be a highly productive member of the team to help the organization achieve their goals promptly and completely.</p>`,

    bio: `<p>I was born and raised in Everett, Mass., a small city just outside of Boston. I am the middle child with an older brother and a little sister. During my senior year of high school I had no idea what I wanted to do. I knew almost nothing about the Armed Services, but I felt like I needed to join the military in order to get anywhere in life (at the time). I made the decision to enlist in the United Stated Marine Corps at the end of my Senior year and that was the first, best decision I ever made for myself. I was always athletic, an All-Star cheerleader, coach, and very competitive!</p>

    <p>During my Four years Active Duty, I began as a Private and received an Honorable Discharge as a Corporal. I held the billet of Regimental Armory Chief for majority of my enlistment and, overall, I grew as a disciplined, hard-working, and more motivated individual.</p>

    <p>I decided not to re-enlist because I am also a mother. I want to give my son more of my time without the restrictions of being enlisted. I love the military, especially the Corps, and I am passionate about assisting others going through the trials and tribulations that come with transitioning into civilian life, no matter the circumstance.</p>

    <p>Since transitioning, I’ve earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Criminal Justice with a focus on juvenile corrections and I am in my 2L year as a full-time law school student. During Undergrad I earned multiple academic awards (Presidents List with Distinction and Deans List with Distinction) and I believe the military instills certain characteristics in people that sometimes they don’t realize for themselves. I’ve applied these same acquired skills, like origination and discipline, into my law school journey and I will continue to progress, while motivating others to pursue their dreams, too.</p>

    <p>I’ve completed an internship with the Massachusetts Department of Corrections, where I worked with women from the work-release program on their interviewing strategies, strengths and weaknesses, resume building, and other transiting skills to succeed in civilian life. This taught me how different we all are and that how we react to our own situations, makes all the difference. I enjoy making an impact on the lives of others, especially women, mothers, and mother figures alike.</p>

    <p>I also completed an internship with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue Litigation Bureau. I worked through tax law cases and analyzed individual’s needs, on a case-by-case basis. It taught me how to work with attorneys and how to apply my military thought process in an office environment. From the Department of Revenue, I applied to law school and got accepted! Another great decision (to actually apply).</p>

    <p>My son is now 7-years-old and when I am not reading cases, outlining, and studying, I am the team mom for my son’s football team. I, like most moms, need to ensure he’s at all the practices for every sport on the planet and homework is done everyday. It can be stressful, trust me, I understand. So, it’s important for veterans, mothers, and families to connect and motivate each other through non-profits, like Veterans of War Aid, of which I am the Ambassador of, and I believe in the foundation’s vision for the future of our veterans.</p>`,
